## mricron/1.0.20190902 ##
MRIcroGL is a cross-platform tool for viewing DICOM and NIfTI format images. It provides a drag-and-drop user interface as well as a scripting language. Please see the wiki page from more details. Note that the wiki page describes version 1.0 of the software, while this Github page is for the upcoming version 1.2. The changes are in general subtle, but the scripting has changed quite a bit.


Example:
```
MRIcron
```
